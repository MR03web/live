# Edge streaming {#concept_agt_3k3_bfb .concept}

## Introduction {#section_dt1_dqc_5db .section}

The edge streaming function preferentially pushes your video streams to the optimal CDN node to ensure that users can access the best uplink network. Besides, it can minimize such problems as video lagging and slow stream-pulling ratio caused by uplink transmission.

## Advantages {#section_cbs_dqc_5db .section}

Wide coverage: over 1,500 CDN nodes all over the world, and over 700 nodes in mainland China, covering main stream cities and regions.

Intelligentization: to preferentially access the CDN node nearest users, so as to ensure the transmission stability.

## Comparison between edge streaming and center streaming {#section_x2t_dqc_5db .section}
