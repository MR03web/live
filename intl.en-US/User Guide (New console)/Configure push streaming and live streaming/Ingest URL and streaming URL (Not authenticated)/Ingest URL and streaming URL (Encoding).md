# Ingest URL and streaming URL \(Encoding\) {#concept_txp_k1z_lfb .concept}

In some special scenarios, the authentication operation must be disabled. This article introduces how to splice the encoding streaming URL and the corresponding ingest URL when the authentication function is disabled.

**Note:** 

-   This article introduces how to get the spliced URLs manually. You can also get the ingest URL and the streaming URL in the console. For more information, see [Configure edge ingestion](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New console)/Configure push streaming and live streaming/Configure edge ingestion.md#).
-   If you want to create multiple live activities , you can also splice the ingest URL and the streaming URL in bulk. For more information , see [Create multiple live activities](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New console)/Configure push streaming and live streaming/Create multiple live activities.md#).
-   If you don't configure encoding service for your live activities, for more information about the splicing rules of ingest URL and streaming URL, see [Ingest URL and streaming URL \(Original\)](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New console)/Configure push streaming and live streaming/Ingest URL and streaming URL (Not authenticated)/Ingest URL and streaming URL (Original).md#).
-   In this article, the ingest URL and the streaming URL in the example are for your reference only. You can follow the splicing rules to get your own ingest URL and streaming URL by using your ingest domain, streaming domain, Application Name, Stream Name and the authentication string obtained by authentication.

## Prerequisites {#section_rx2_vkx_wfb .section}

Perform the following operations to get the ingest URL and streaming URL:

-   Add a domain name

    You must first created an ingest domain and a streaming domain that have completed ICP filing. For more information, see [Add a domain name](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New console)/Domain names management/Manage a domain name/Add a domain name.md#).

-   Configure CNAME

    After adding a domain, you must configure the CNAME for it to take effect. For more information about how to configure CNAME, see [Configure CNAME](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New console)/Domain names management/Configure CNAME.md#).

-   Associate domain names

    After creating domain names, you must associate the ingest domain and the streaming domain before you perform stream ingestion and live streaming operations. For more information, see [Associate domain names](reseller.en-US/User Guide (New console)/Domain names management/Manage a domain name/Associate domain names.md#).


## How do I get encoding ingest URL? {#section_hyt_qf5_xfb .section}

-   Generation rules of ingest URL

    ApsaraVideo Live service supports ingest URL in RTMP format only.

    The ingest URL format is `RTMP://Ingest Domain nName/AppName/StreamName`

-   Examples

    For example, the Ingest Domain Name is `push.aliyunlive.com`, Application Name is app, Stream Name is stream, and the ingest URL is `RTMP://push.aliyunlive.com/app/stream`


## How do I get encoding streaming URL? {#section_f5s_5f5_xfb .section}

You must first configure encoding. ApsaraVideo Live supports universal encoding and custom encoding. Each encoding provides Narrowband HDTM. After you configure encoding and obtain the template ID, you can splice the encoding streaming URL based on the splicing rules.

1.  Configure encoding templates.
    -   Configure default encoding
        1.  Click **Domains**.
        2.  Select the **Streaming Domain**, and click **Stream Settings**.
        3.  In **Encoding Settings**, select **Default**, and click **Add**.

    -   Configure custom encoding
        1.  Log on to the ApsaraVideo Live console.
        2.  Click **Domains**.
        3.  Select the **Streaming Domain**, and click **Stream Settings**.
        4.  In **Encoding settings**, select **Custom**, and click **Add**.

2.  Get ID.
    -   Get the ID in the ApsaraVideo Live console.

        You can obtain the corresponding template ID by following the previous steps.

    -   Get the ID by using API.

        You can call the `DescribeLiveStreamTranscodeInfo` interface, and the system returns the ID. For more information, see [DescribeLiveStreamTranscodeInfo](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/45048.htm?spm=a2c63.p38356.b99.88.704a42bdIcY4xm).

        In addition, users can customize template based on added fields. For more information about getting custom ID, see [AddCustomLiveStreamTranscode](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/66944.htm?spm=a2c63.p38356.b99.86.678a652324n3ps).

3.  Splicing rules of encoding URL.
    -   Streaming URL supports RMTP, FLV, and HLS formats. For encoding URLs in different formats, you must add `_templateid` following `StreamName`.
        -   RTMP formatï¼š`:rtmp://Streaming Domain Name/AppName/StreamName{_templateid}?`
        -   FLV format:`http://Streaming Domain Name/AppName/StreamName{_templateid}.flv?`
        -   HLS format:`http://Streaming Domain Name/AppName/StreamName{_templateid}.m3u8?`
    -   Examples

        For example, the Streaming Domain Name is `play.aliyunlive.com`, the Application Name is app, the Stream Name is stream, and the authentication key is 456, then the streaming URL is:

        -   RTMP-based streaming URL `rtmp://play.aliyunlive.com/app/stream_sd`
        -   FLV-based streaming URL `http://play.aliyunlive.com/app/stream_sd.flv?`
        -   HLS-based streaming URL `http://play.aliyunlive.com/app/stream_sd.m3u8`
        **Note:** M3u8 encoding URL is already supported. If you have more requirements, open a ticket.
